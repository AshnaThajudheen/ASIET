Create a window (JFrame) with title "Traffic Lights".
Add a label (JLabel) to show traffic light status.
Add three radio buttons ("Red", "Yellow", "Green").
Group the radio buttons so only one can be selected.
When a radio button is selected:
If "Red" is selected, show "Stop" and set color to red.
If "Yellow" is selected, show "Ready" and set color to yellow.
If "Green" is selected, show "Go" and set color to green.
Show the window and allow it to close when done.
End
